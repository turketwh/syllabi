# CSC 201 - Spring 2025 - Course Description

## Bulletin entry

A study of fundamental data structures and the algorithms that act upon them. Data structure topics include the application, implementation, and complexity analysis of trees, hash tables, heaps, maps, sets, and graphs. 
Algorithmic topics include advanced sorting and searching methods and an introduction to divide-and-conquer and greedy techniques, graph algorithms, backtracking, and dynamic programming. [[source]](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/departments-programs/computer-science/#coursestext)

## Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, and MTH 117.  In particular, all students are expected to be comfortable with:

* The fundamentals of *computer programming in Java*
* The basics of *object-oriented programming*
* The ideas of *recursion* and *recurrence relations*
* The fundamentals of *linear data structures*, such as *arrays* and *linked lists*


## Weekly flow of the course

*NOTE: The first week will have a different cadence than other weeks in the course. The weekly flow is for the work starting after the first few days of class meetings*.

On *Thursday* of each week, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for the next week.  The module will consist of three parts, named *Preparation*, *Engagement*, and *Departure*.

The *Preparation* is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done between the time on Thursday it is released and _Monday night at 11:59pm_ it is due. I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module could take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:

* Links to documents to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week.
* A link to a *Preparation Assessment*, representing a few questions related to the content in the readings and videos. The questions should, in most cases, be directly from the readings and videos. 
* The last question in the *Preparation Assessment* will be open ended, allowing you to share with me questions or concerns you have about the preparation material.

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives.

Finally, the *Departure* component of the module will consist of a set of after-class problems due on *Wednesdays at 11:59pm*. These are to provide additional practice with the material and types of problems we have been addressing.

Note that this means once the class gets going, each week you will be both working on:

* the *pre-class Preparation activity* for the material in the upcoming week
* the *post-class Departure activity* for the material from the current week

Neither the *Preparation* or the *Departure* assessments are *required*, but they are *highly encouraged*.

## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

The *Preparation* and *Departure*, if submitted, will be scored as 1 point each, but they do not factor into your overall grade. The 1 point is to facilitate my recordkeeping of having given feedback on these optional assessments.

There will be three *tests* over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.

There will be four *practicals*. The first will be lighter-weighted than the other three. The purpose of the first will primarily be to make sure you are comfortable with the tools we'll be using in the course and to refresh your Java programming.

## Course grades

|     Assessment      | Points Possible | Percentage |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :--------: |
|       Test 1        |       50        |    20%     |
|       Test 2        |       50        |    20%     |
|       Test 3        |       50        |    20%     |
|      Practical 1    |       13        |    5.2%    |
|      Practical 2    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      Practical 3    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      Practical 4    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      **Total**      |     **250**     |  **100%**  |

The points earned on assessments will be divided by 250 and the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.

| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |
| :-------------------------: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------: |
|          93 - 100           |     A        |         73 - 76.99          |     C        |
|         90 - 92.99          |      A-      |         70 - 72.99          |      C-      |
|         87 - 89.99          |      B+      |         67 - 69.99          |      D+      |
|         83 - 86.99          |     B        |         63 - 66.99          |     D        |
|         80 - 82.99          |      B-      |         60 - 62.99          |      D-      |
|         77 - 79.99          |      C+      |          0 - 59.99          |      F       |
