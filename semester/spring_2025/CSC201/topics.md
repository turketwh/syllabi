# CSC 201 - Spring 2025 - Course Topics

The learning objectives for the course are:
* Analyze the runtime efficiency of low- to medium-complexity algorithms, especially algorithms associated with data structures learned in this class
* Chose an appropriate algorithm or data structure for a given problem in order to meet the problemâ€™s runtime/space requirements based on an understanding of the tradeoffs between algorithms or between data structures
* Design, debug, modify, implement, and test operations such as (but not limited to) insertion, deletion, search, and related operations for variants of data structures discussed in the course
* Design, debug, modify, and test variants of algorithms discussed in the course

Topics covered in the course are expected to include, but are not limited to, the following. The topics are not necessarily in order of presentation during the course.
At the end of the semester, this list will be updated to reflect the actual course coverage.

* Code analysis
* Case analysis
* Sorting algorithms
* Trees
  * Binary trees
    * Binary search trees
    * Heaps
  * Traversal
* Hashing and hash tables
* Graphs
  * Representations
  * Traversals
* Sets
* _More to be added..._
