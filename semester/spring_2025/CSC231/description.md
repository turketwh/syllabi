# CSC 231 - Spring 2025 - Course Description

## Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, and MST 117.  In particular, all students are expected to be comfortable with:

* The fundamentals of *computer programming in Java*
* The basics of *object-oriented programming*
* The ideas of *recursion*


## Weekly flow of the course

*NOTE: The first week will have a different cadence than other weeks in the course. The weekly flow is for the work starting after the first few days of class meetings*.

On *Friday* of each week, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for the next week.  The module will consist of three parts, named *Preparation*, *Engagement*, and *Departure*.

The *Preparation* is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done between the time on Friday it is released and the time on Tuesday night it is due. I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module could take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:

* Links to documents to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week.
* A link to a *Preparation Assessment*, representing a few questions related to the content in the readings and videos for which you will need to submit the answers. The questions should, in most cases, be directly from the readings. 
* The last question in the *Preparation Assessment* will be open ended, allowing you to share with me questions or concerns you have about the preparation material.

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives.

Finally, the *Departure* component of the module will consist of a set of after-class problems due on *Thursdays at 11:59pm*. These are to provide additional practice with the material and types of problems we have been addressing.

Note that this means once the class gets going, each week you will be both working on:

* the *pre-class Preparation activity* for the material in the upcoming week
* the *post-class Departure activity* for the material from the recently completed week
  
The *Preparation* and *Departure* activities are *optional* but *encouraged*.

## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

In most weeks, there should be optional assignments due each Tuesday and Thursday at 11:59pm:

* Tuesdays at 11:59pm: The *Preparation* assignment for the upcoming module
* Thursdays at 11:59pm: The *Departure* assignment for the recently completed module

The *Preparation* and *Departure* work, if submitted, will be scored on a 1 point scale. This 1 point scale is just to help me keep track of their utility to students and these, since they are optional, do not count towards the final grade.

There will be three *tests* over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.

There will be four *practicals*. The first will be lighter-weighted than the other three.

## Course grades

|     Assessment      | Points Possible | Percentage |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :--------: |
|       Test 1        |       50        |    20%     |
|       Test 2        |       50        |    20%     |
|       Test 3        |       50        |    20%     |
|      Practical 1    |       13       |    5.2%    |
|      Practical 2    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      Practical 3    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      Practical 4    |       29        |   11.6%    |
|      **Total**      |     **250**     |  **100%**  |

The points earned on assessments will be divided by 250 and the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.

| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |
| :-------------------------: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------: |
|          93 - 100           |     A        |         73 - 76.99          |     C        |
|         90 - 92.99          |      A-      |         70 - 72.99          |      C-      |
|         87 - 89.99          |      B+      |         67 - 69.99          |      D+      |

|         80 - 82.99          |      B-      |         60 - 62.99          |      D-      |
|         77 - 79.99          |      C+      |          0 - 59.99          |      F       |
