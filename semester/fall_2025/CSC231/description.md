# CSC 231 - Fall 2025 - Course Description

**Until this note is removed, this document is still a DRAFT and could continue to change!**

## Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, and MST 117.  In particular, all students are expected to be comfortable with:

* The fundamentals of *computer programming in Java*
* The basics of *object-oriented programming*
* The ideas of *recursion*


## Weekly flow of the course

On *Wednesday* of each week, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for upcoming Friday and following Wednesday.  

The material listed in the *Preparation* section of the module is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done before the upcoming Wednesday and Friday class meetings (preparation for each class meeting is broken out). I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module could take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:

* Links to documents to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week.
* Example problems relating to the material

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives. 
*Engagement* work may contain a mix of conceptual and programming questions.

Any *Engagement* work not completed during a class session should be continued at home. 

*Engagement* work will center around shared documents within the Google documents environment - mainly, Google Colab notebooks. After each class meeting, I will review and provide feedback (via comments in the Google documents) on your progress on the *Engagement* work.

## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

There will be three *tests* over the semester, approximately one per month. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.
Each problem on a test will focus on one major course topic. There will be 15 major course topics tested. Each problem will be marked as:

* `E`: Expectations met
* `P`: Progressing
* `M`: Major issues

The final exam block will be an *optional reassessment period* where students can indicate which, if any, course topics they would like to be reassessed on.

## Course grades

Course grades will be based on the distribution of `E`, `P`, and `M` marks earned.

| Letter grade | Thresholds |
|:--:|:--:|
| A  | At least 13 `E` marks and no `M` marks |
| A- | At least 12 `E` marks and no `M` marks |
| B+ | At least 11 `E` marks and no `M` marks |
| B  | At least 11 `E` marks and no more than 1 `M` mark |
| B- | At least 11 `E` marks and no more than 2 `M` marks |
| C+ | At least 10 `E` marks and no `M` marks |
| C  | At least 10 `E` marks and no more than 2 `M` marks |
| C- | At least 10 `E` marks and no more than 4 `M` marks |
| D+ | At least 9 `E` marks and no `M` marks |
| D  | At least 9 `E` marks and no more than 2 `M` marks |
| D- | At least 9 `E` marks and no more than 4 `M` marks |
