# CSC 301 - Fall 2025 - Course Topics

## Big questions

The big questions tackled in this class are:

* Given an algorithm,
  - Is its solution correct?
  - How much work does it require to determine a solution, and can we do better?
* What are major categories of algorithmic design techniques (what tools do I have in my toolbox)?
* Are there problems that are too difficult to solve, and, if so, can solutions be approximated?

## Learning objectives

After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. Analyze algorithms using *asymptotic complexity analysis* (`Big-Oh` and related notation)
2. Prove the correctness of algorithms using rigorous techniques such as *mathematical induction* and *proof by contradiction*
3. Design efficient algorithms for problems, using approaches that include *divide and conquer*, *dynamic programming*, *greedy methods*, and *parallelization*
4. Identify *NP-complete problems* and devise strategies to deal with them
