# CSC 301 - Fall 2025 - Course Description

**Until this note is removed, this document is still a DRAFT and could continue to change!**

## Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, MTH 112, MTH 117, and CSC 201.

## Weekly flow of the course

On *Wednesday* of each week, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for upcoming Friday and following Wednesday.  

The material listed in the *Preparation* section of the module is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done before the upcoming Friday and Wednesday class meetings (preparation for each class meeting is broken out). I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module could take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:

* Links to documents to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week.
* Example problems relating to the material

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives. 
*Engagement* work may contain a mix of conceptual and programming questions.

Any *Engagement* work not completed during a class session should be continued at home. 

*Engagement* work will center around shared documents within the Google documents environment - mainly, Google Colab notebooks. After each class meeting, I will review and provide feedback (via comments in the Google documents) on your progress on the *Engagement* work.



## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

There will be three *tests* over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.

There will be three *practicals* which are take-home assignments that may include both _conceptual_ and _programming_ questions.

## Course grades

|     Assessment      | Points Possible | Percentage |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :--------: |
|       Test 1        |       50        |    25%     |
|       Test 2        |       50        |    25%     |
|       Test 3        |       50        |    25%     |
|      Practical 1    |       16        |    8%    |
|      Practical 2    |       17        |   8.5%    |
|      Practical 3    |       17        |   8.5%    |
|      **Total**      |     **200**     |  **100%**  |

The points earned on assessments will be divided by 200 and the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.

| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |
| :-------------------------: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------: |
|          93 - 100           |     A        |         73 - 76.99          |     C        |
|         90 - 92.99          |      A-      |         70 - 72.99          |      C-      |
|         87 - 89.99          |      B+      |         67 - 69.99          |      D+      |
