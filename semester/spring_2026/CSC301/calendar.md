# CSC 301 - Spring 2026 - Course Calendar

*Until this banner is removed, this document should be considered a **draft***.

## Academic Course Dates

### Preparation

Preparation work for each day, including a *Preparation Quiz* when published, should be completed by midnight before the class meeting it is associated with.

### Practicals

All practicals are due at 11:59pm on the due date. You have a total of 96 hours of "no questions asked extra time" to use across all the practicals (if you use all 96 hours of "extra time" on the first practical, there is no extra time on the remaining practicals).  Practicals submitted late (when considering the extra time above) will receive feedback but a grade of 0.

Specific dates have not yet been set for the *practicals*, but you can assume there will be one each in February, March, and April, with at least two weeks to be completed.

| Date Released | Date Due | Event |

Unless otherwise indicated, the tests will be during the course meeting on a given day. The last test is being given during the final exam block assigned for the course. The times for all final exams can be found in this [document](https://prod.wp.cdn.aws.wfu.edu/sites/120/2025/06/25-26-Final-Exam-Schedule.pdf) published by the Registrar's Office.

Given our exam block is the next-to-the-last day of exams, an earlier offering (likely on Sunday, May 3) will also be provided.
