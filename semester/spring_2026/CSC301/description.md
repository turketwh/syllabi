# CSC 301 - Spring 2026 - Course Description

*Until this banner is removed, this document should be considered a **draft**.*

## Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, MTH 112, MTH 117, and CSC 201.

## Weekly flow of the course

### Preparation

After most class meetings, *preparation material* for the next class meeting will be shared in Canvas.  For a given day, I would expect about 30 minutes of reading and or videos, as well as completion of a *reading quiz*. While this work does not count towards your course grade, it is expected that it is completed in order to be ready for the next class session.

### Engagement 

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives. This *engagement* work may contain a mix of conceptual and programming questions.

## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

There will be three *tests* over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.

There will be three *practicals* which are take-home assignments that may include both _conceptual_ and _programming_ questions.

The points earned on assessments will be divided by 200 and the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.

| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |
| :-------------------------: | :----------: | :-------------------------: | :----------: |
|          93 - 100           |     A        |         73 - 76.99          |     C        |
