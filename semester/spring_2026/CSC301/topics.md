# CSC 301 - Spring 2026 - Course Topics

*Until this banner is removed, this document should be considered a **draft***.

## Big questions

The big questions tackled in this class are:

* Given an algorithm,
  - Is its solution correct?
  - How much work does it require to determine a solution, and can we do better?
* What are major categories of algorithmic design techniques (what tools do I have in my toolbox)?
* Are there problems that are too difficult to solve, and, if so, can solutions be approximated?
* How does my algorithmic thinking need to change if I have more than one processor available?

## Learning objectives

After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:
