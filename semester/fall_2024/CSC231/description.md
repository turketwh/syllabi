# CSC 231 - Fall 2024 - Course Description

## Learning

### Big questions 

There are two *big questions* that the course content and activities will focus on:

* How is the *language* part of programming languages processed?
	* This material will examine the processes of compilation and interpretation, representations for specifying languages, and algorithms for recognizing language structures.
* What *styles* of programming languages exist?
	* This material will examine the utility and design of a spectrum of languages, particularly considering how features of a given language make it suitable for a particular style of problem domain


As time allows and where relevant, the following question will also be addressed: 

* What *mechanisms* do modern programming languages support?
	* This material will primarily examine a range of language design features, possible implementations of those features, and costs for supporting such features.

### Learning objectives

After successful completion of this course, students should be able to:

1. Make use of and, for low to medium complexity scenarios, design computational tools that represent/recognize language structures
2. Justify the design of a programming language feature based on the context of its use
3. Simulate the mechanisms behind the implementations of programming language features
4. Read and interpret solutions to non-trivial problems written in various styles of programming languages
5. Write solutions to low complexity problems using various styles of programming languages
6. Provide written interpretations of code and analyses for other computer scientists to consume
7. Design appropriate tests for developed solutions

### Prior knowledge assumptions

Students are expected to have background knowledge equivalent to the completion of the WFU courses of CSC 111, CSC 112, and MST 117.  In particular, all students are expected to be comfortable with:

* The fundamentals of *computer programming in Java*
* The basics of *object-oriented programming*
* The ideas of *recursion*


## Weekly flow of the course

*NOTE: The first week will have a different cadence than other weeks in the course. The weekly flow is for the work starting after the first few days of class meetings*.

On *Friday* of each week, you will be provided access to a new module in Canvas that will be the focus for the next week.  The module will consist of three parts, named *Preparation*, *Engagement*, and *Departure*.

The *Preparation* is for you to prepare for the week and work for it should be done between the time on Friday it is released and the time on Tuesday night it is due. I expect the work in the *Preparation* part of each module could take between 1 and 1.5 hours to complete. It will consist of:

* Links to documents to read and videos to watch as preparation for the week
* A link to a *Preparation Quiz*, representing a few questions related to the content in the readings and videos for which you will need to submit the answers. The questions should, in most cases, be directly from the readings. 
* The last question in the *Preparation Quiz* will be open ended, allowing you to share with me questions or concerns you have about the preparation material

*Engagement* happens during our normal class times, as well as can happen during office hours. The majority of class sessions will be a mix of short lecture to reinforce ideas and engagement with a set of problems relating to the material. Our primary goal will be to use this time we have together (student-instructor and student-student) in order to address activities tied to the course learning objectives.

Finally, the *Departure* component of the module will consist of a set of after-class problems due on *Thursdays at 11:59pm*. These are to provide additional practice with the material and types of problems we have been addressing.

Note that this means once the class gets going, each week you will be both working on:

* the *pre-class Preparation activity* for the material in the upcoming week
* the *post-class Departure activity* for the material from the current week



## Course work and assessment

### Types of assessments

In most weeks, there should be assignments due each Tuesday and Thursday at 11:59pm:

* Tuesdays at 11:59pm: The *Preparation* assignment for the next module
* Thursdays at 11:59pm: The *Departure* assignment for the current module

The *Preparation* and *Departure* work will be graded for completion and account for a small portion of the overall grade.  At the end of the semester, the lowest scoring *Preparation* and the lowest scoring *Departure* assignment scores will be dropped (this allow a free *miss* of one of these assignments).

There will be three *tests* over the semester, including the final exam. The three tests will be closed-book, done-in-class tests.  The tests will not be explicitly cumulative, other than the natural fact that ideas introduced later in the course build on ideas from earlier in the course.

There will be four *practicals*. The first will be lighter-weighted than the other three.

The points earned on assessments will be divided by 250 and the resulting numerical grade value will be converted to a letter grade based on the ranges shown in the table below.

| Numerical grade value range | Letter grade | Numerical grade value range | Letter grade |
