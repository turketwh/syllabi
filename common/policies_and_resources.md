# Course policies and resources

## Communication and availability

My goals with respect to communications are as follows:

* Response to emails and requests for meetings: Ideally, by the end of the same business day; if not, within 24 hours
* Feedback on low-stakes assignments: Within three days of the due date
* Feedback on tests and projects: Within ten days of the due date

## Course attendance

While attendance will not directly factor into your course grade, attendance at class sessions is strategic for success in this class.  In particular, it is during class sessions when we will address the most challenging components of the course content and when students will be able to work together synergistically.

Please provide documentation of known excused absences, such as for athletic or academic events officially sanctioned by the University, within the first two weeks of the semester.

## Late work

For any *Practicals*, you have a budget of 4 late days (total) to use throughout the semester at your discretion. I will help you keep track of the balance of late days you have left.  Here is how the late days work:

* You do not need to explain why you used the late day(s).
* Late day use calculations are rounded up to the nearest half-day increment.
  * For example, submitting an assignment:
	  * 11 hours late uses a *half* day
	  * 17 hours late uses 1 day
	  * 26 hours late uses 1.5 days
	  * ...
* You may use at most 3 late days on any single assignment.
* Work submitted late when the late day balance is 0 or that goes over 3 days for any one assignment will receive a 0 as a grade.  I will still provide feedback on your work.

Make up tests will only be allowed for officially sanctioned University events or clear cases (where *clear* is determined by the instructor) where students are unable to attend class.

Assignments that are not *Practicals*, such as *Preparation activity* and *Departure activity* assignments, must be turned in by their deadline.

## Student wellness

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can interfere with learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, substance use, stressful events, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. Such concerns may diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. There are a wealth of resources on campus to help in these situations. A good starting point is the WFU Counseling Center (website: [https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/](https://counselingcenter.wfu.edu/), location: Reynolda 117, phone: 336-758-5273).

If you are experiencing challenges, please reach out to me, sharing as little or as much as you like.  I will do my best to work with you in a fair way to address your needs with respect to the class.

## Inclusion

Wake Forest University provides reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities and accessibility concerns. If you are in need of an accommodation, then please contact me privately as early in the term as possible. Retroactive accommodations will not be provided. Students requiring accommodations must also (and should first) consult the Center for Learning, Access, and Student Success (website: [https://class.wfu.edu](http://class.wfu.edu), location: 118 Reynolda Hall, phone: 336-758-5929, ).

If there is any point where you feel I have acted in a discriminatory manner, I encourage you to bring it to my attention after class so I can correct it in the future.  If you prefer to talk to someone other than me, I would ask that you reach out to Dr. Santago, one of the senior faculty members in our department.

## AI Policy

Unless explicitly told otherwise, AI tools (ChatGPT, etc.) should not be used on any work submitted for feedback (formative or summative) in the course.

## Academic integrity

Wake Forest is an academic community that subscribes to an honor system.  By accepting membership in this community, each student assumes the obligation to be trustworthy in all pursuits. Unless otherwise specified, all work submitted for this course should be your own work and reflect your understanding of the material. Using all or portions of work from current students, previous students, or external (including Internet-based and generative AI) resources, as well as sharing your work with other students, are not acceptable and are considered a violation of academic integrity. Sharing evaluation (test) questions with others internal or external to the University is also considered a violation of academic integrity.  Violations will be handled through the WFU honor system mechanisms. It is recommended that you retain drafts of your work until the end of the semester in case a question arises as to authorship.

## Use of technology

In our class meetings, please use whatever technology helps you to learn, under the constraints of:

* Do not engage in behavior that distracts others from learning
* Faculty hold copyright over their course content, including the course lecture

During assessments, technological tools are not allowed unless otherwise specified by the instructor or needed as an accommodation.

## University closure

In the event that the University physically closes, the course will continue as an online course with class meetings held through a video conferencing tool, such as Zoom.

As conditions change at the University, it may be necessary to update the calendar for the course, including the due dates for assignments and scheduling of assessments (including the assessments released during the final exam period).

## University grievance procedure

Per the [University bulletin](https://bulletin.wfu.edu/undergraduate/wake-forest-college/student-complaints/), the grievance procedure for academic setting complaints is as follows:

> For complaints in the academic (i.e., classroom) setting, the student should talk personally with or send a written complaint explaining the concern directly to the instructor. Should the student and instructor be unable to resolve the conflict, the student may then turn to the chair of the involved department (in the Wake Forest School of Business, this would be the dean) for assistance. The chair (or dean) will communicate with both parties, seek to understand their individual perspectives, and within a reasonable time, reach a conclusion and share it with both parties. If the student's complaint is not resolved by these procedures, the student should consult with the Office of Academic Advising for assistance. The Associate Dean for Academic Advising will consult with the parties to obtain a resolution. Finally, a student may appeal to the Committee on Academic Affairs which will study the matter, taking input from all parties, and reach a final decision concerning resolution.
